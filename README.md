# teamlucc_testhhat_idl

This folder contains `testthat` unit tests for the 
[`teamlucc`](https://github.com/azvoleff/teamlucc) package. All of these tests 
depend on having an IDL installation in order to run. As many of these tests 
also require relatively large data files, they are not located in the main 
`teamlucc` repository. This folder is not required for most users of `teamlucc` 
- you only need to install these files along with `teamlucc` if you have an IDL 
license, and want to fully test the `teamlucc` package, or if you want access 
to the sample data included here.
